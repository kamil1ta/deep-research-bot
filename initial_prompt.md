i'm creating a deep research bot for my blog where i post thinkpieces

this is what i've been manually doing:
- dive deep into tech twitter myself
- watch tiktok and youtube
- open reddit forums
- read articles by VCs like a16z
- read books from authors like chris dixon and mustafa suleyman
- and much more you get the gist... it's tiring

so, what i want the bot to do is - do all that for me :D
i am too lazy to read so need a bot to do my research for me
what the bot will basically do is research the web based on the relevant topic of my thinkpiece
and then pour the result of the research to notion, containing the following:
1. create a page for each source
2. each source should include:
- source / url
- snapshot of content - tl;dr
- what they're basically trying to say
- how they tie to the other content you've researched
3. after that create a different page summarising all the research that you've done for the specific topic
4. each topic should have their own database

let's get building!
